#Homebrew install:
#
#   if builds of PostgreSQL 9 are failing and you have version 8.x installed,
# you may need to remove the previous version first. See:
#   https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/issues/issue/2510

# To migrate existing data from a previous major version (pre-9.3) of PostgreSQL, see:
#   http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/static/upgrading.html

# When installing the postgres gem, including ARCHFLAGS is recommended:
#   ARCHFLAGS="-arch x86_64" gem install pg

# To install gems without sudo, see the Homebrew wiki.

# To have launchd start postgresql at login:
#     ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/postgresql/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
# Then to load postgresql now:
#     launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.postgresql.plist
# Or, if you don't want/need launchctl, you can just run:
#     postgres -D /usr/local/var/postgres
# ==> /usr/local/Cellar/postgresql/9.3.3/bin/initdb /usr/local/var/postgres -E utf8
# ==> Summary
# 🍺  /usr/local/Cellar/postgresql/9.3.3: 2923 files, 38M
